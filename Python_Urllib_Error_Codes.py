# Python Urllib
# Fetching Internet Resources Using The urllib Package
# urllib.request is a Python module for fetching URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).
# It offers a very simple interface, in the form of the urlopen function.
# This is capable of fetching URLs using a variety of different protocols.
# It also offers a slightly more complex interface for handling common situations - like basic authentication, cookies, proxies and so on.
# These are provided by objects called handlers and openers.
# 
# urllib.request supports fetching URLs for many “URL schemes” (identified by the string before the ":" in URL - for example "ftp" is the URL scheme of
# "ftp://python.org/") using their associated network protocols (e.g. FTP, HTTP).
# This tutorial focuses on the most common case, HTTP.
# 
# For straightforward situations urlopen is very easy to use.
# But as soon as you encounter errors or non-trivial cases when opening HTTP URLs, you will need some understanding of the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
# The most comprehensive and authoritative reference to HTTP is RFC 2616.
# This is a technical document and not intended to be easy to read.
# This aim here is to illustrate using urllib, with enough detail about HTTP to help you through.
# It is not intended to replace the urllib.request docs, but is supplementary to them.
#

#
# Error Codes:
# Because the default handlers handle redirects (codes in the 300 range), and codes in the 100–299 range indicate success, you will usually only see error
# codes in the 400–599 range.
#

# 
# http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.responses is a useful dictionary of response codes in that shows all the response codes used by RFC 2616.
# The dictionary is reproduced here for convenience
# 

# Table mapping response codes to messages; entries have the
# form {code: (shortmessage, longmessage)}.
